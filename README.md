## Tumblr Tools

---

This Script uses the Tumblr API to download `likes` and `posts` form any blog to your local machine in the `json` format. You can also filter the downloaded posts for `tags`, `users`, `content` (keywords) and `post-type`.

**Before use:**

You need to register an API key on Tumblr and write it into the script.
